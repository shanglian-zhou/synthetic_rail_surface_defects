(updated on 02/28/2025) 
Dataset 1: synthetic-Rail Surface Discrete Defects-30k (synthetic-RSDDs-30k)
A total of 30,000 synthetic images were generated through a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) for rail surface defect segmentation tasks.

Dataset 2: synthetic-Rail Surface Discrete Defects-6.4k with adaptive MCMC sampling for synthetic image exploration and refinement
A total of 6,400 synthetic images were generated through a CGAN with an adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-guided image-label space exploration and refinement sampling process to enhance image diversity and quality. Data refined by MCMC sampling will be released soon.
